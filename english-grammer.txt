=====================
📌 WHEN TO USE WOULD
=====================

Would is the past form of “will”, but it is used in many situations, not only past.

1️⃣ Polite requests (very common use)

We use would to sound soft, respectful, and polite.

Structure
Would + subject + base verb

Examples
• Would you help me?
• Would you like some tea?
• Would you mind opening the door?

👉 More polite than will.

2️⃣ Imaginary / unreal situations (Conditionals)

Used when the situation is not real, only imagined.

Structure
If + past tense, subject + would + verb

Examples
• If I were rich, I would buy a car.
• If he studied, he would pass.

👉 Means: this is not happening now.

3️⃣ Past habit (similar to “used to”)

Used to talk about things that happened regularly in the past, but not now.

Examples
• When I was a child, I would play outside every day.
• My grandfather would tell stories at night.

👉 Do NOT use for past states
Wrong ❌ I would be shy.
Correct ✔ I used to be shy.

4️⃣ Indirect / reported speech

When we change will → would while reporting.

Direct
• He said, “I will help you.”

Indirect
• He said he would help me.

5️⃣ Offers and invitations

Sounds gentle and friendly.

Examples
• Would you like to join us?
• Would you care for some coffee?

6️⃣ Preferences (what someone likes more)

Used with rather.

Structure
Would rather + base verb

Examples
• I would rather stay home.
• She would rather walk than take a bus.

7️⃣ Future in the past

Talking about the future from a past point of view.

Examples
• I knew he would come.
• She promised she would call.

🔁 WOULD vs WILL vs COULD
Word	Usage
will	direct, strong, certain
would	polite, imaginary, indirect
could	polite + ability/possibility

Example
• Will you help me? (direct)
• Would you help me? (polite)
• Could you help me? (polite + ability)

🧠 SUPER EASY MEMORY RULE

Use WOULD when:
✔ you want to be polite
✔ you are imagining something
✔ you talk about past habits
✔ you report future from the past

📌 One-line Summary

Would = polite + imaginary + past habit + future in past

=====================
📌 WHEN TO USE SHOULD
=====================

Should is mainly used for advice, expectation, and moral duty.
It is not as strong as “must”, and not as weak as “may”.

1️⃣ Advice / Suggestion (MOST COMMON USE)

Use should when you tell someone what is good or correct to do.

Structure
Subject + should + base verb

Examples
• You should study daily.
• He should exercise more.
• You should not smoke.

👉 Means: It is a good idea.

2️⃣ Expectation (what is likely to happen)

Use should when you expect something normally.

Examples
• The train should arrive by 6 PM.
• She should be at home now.

👉 Means: Probably / I expect so.

3️⃣ Moral duty / responsibility

Used when something is right or fair to do.

Examples
• Children should respect their parents.
• We should help the poor.

👉 Not a law, but a moral rule.

4️⃣ Obligation (weak, polite form)

Used when duty exists, but not strict like “must”.

Examples
• You should submit the report today.
• Employees should follow company rules.

5️⃣ Negative advice (should not / shouldn’t)

Used to say something is wrong or a bad idea.

Examples
• You should not drive fast.
• He shouldn’t lie.

6️⃣ Past advice / regret (IMPORTANT FOR EXAMS)

Use should have + V3 when:
• advice was given
• action was not done
• result is regret

Structure
Subject + should have + V3

Examples
• You should have studied harder.
• I should have called her earlier.

👉 Means: Now it is too late.

7️⃣ Asking for advice (questions)

Examples
• What should I do now?
• Should I accept the offer?

🔁 SHOULD vs MUST vs WOULD
Word	Strength	Use
must	very strong	law / rule / no choice
should	medium	advice / duty
would	soft	polite / imaginary

Example
• You must wear a helmet. (law)
• You should wear a helmet. (advice)
• You would wear a helmet if it were free. (imaginary)

🧠 EASY MEMORY LINE

Should = good idea + advice + expectation + weak duty

⚠️ Common Mistakes

Wrong ❌ He should to go
Correct ✔ He should go

Wrong ❌ She should went
Correct ✔ She should go

📌 One-line Summary

Use “should” when you want to guide, advise, or expect — not force.
